# Characteristics of a Stream

| Characteristic    | What it means                                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not a storage** | Streams carry data from a source; they do not hold it        |
| **Functional**    | Operations take lambdas or method references, not statements |
| **Lazy**          | Intermediate steps do not execute until a terminal is called |
| **Single-use**    | Once a terminal operation runs, the stream is consumed       |
| **Possibly parallel** | Any stream can be made parallel with `.parallelStream()` |
